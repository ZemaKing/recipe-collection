// Build-time stand-in for @supabase/realtime-js (ROADMAP Phase 40, from the diecast app).
// vite.config.ts aliases the package to this file: supabase-js always constructs a
// RealtimeClient, but this app never opens a channel, and the real one (with its Phoenix socket
// dependency) was ~55 kB of minified JS on every page. It implements exactly what SupabaseClient
// calls on `this.realtime`; realtime-stub.test.ts reads the installed supabase-js and fails if an
// upgrade starts calling anything else. To use Realtime one day, delete the alias (and this file).
